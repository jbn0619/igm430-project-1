Diony Severino and Justin Neft - IGME 430 Project 1 Documentation - Magic the Gathering Deckbuilder API

1) What your site does and its purpose.
Our site is a Magic the Gathering deckbuilding api. It utilizes the MtG API in order to retrieve data
for various cards from the game, and allows users to name and create their own decks for the game, along with allowing
users to view other and edit other decks that have been created using our API.

2) What part of your app does the API handle?
Our API handles the deckbuilding aspect of the application. When the user clicks Build Deck, or opens an already created
deck, they will be able to add cards to that deck, or make an entirely new deck by filling in a new deck name in the
Deck Name field. The API handles each deck individually, and retrieves card information from the MtG API so the user
can see what card they added to their deck. They may also delete cards that exist in a deck by clicking on them.

3) What went right and what went wrong?
We found that utilizing the external API was a difficult prospect at first, and it caused many errors that due to
some poor communication took awhile to finish. That being said, once those issues were resolved, it was a fairly smooth
project from then on, being able to implement most of our desired features relatively quickly.

4) If you were to continue, what would you do to improve your app?
We would improve the options available for viewing decks, like allowing viewers to see what each card in their deck
actually looks like, along with adding support for deckbuilding for Magic's other formats, like Commander or Brawl.

5) How did you go above and beyond?
Our project went above and beyond by utilizing the Magic the Gathering Deckbuilder API to retrieve accurate card 
information, along with implementing DELETE requests in order to remove information from the server.
